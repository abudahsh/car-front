</h1><br><br><br>

<div>
<h1>Where do you get your data, and how reliable is it?</h1>
<p>Baic obtains and processes data from well-known data aggregators within the automotive space to ensure that we present the most accurate pricing information available. We also acquire vehicle configuration data, customer and dealer incentives data, financing and loan data, vehicle registration and insurance data, and much, much more. Our data is among the most timely and comprehensive in the industry. Our sampling of the total number of car sales nationwide provides us with significant confidence that our data is representative of the market as a whole. Statistical analysis shows that on the whole, we have 99.1% confidence that our projected Average Paid Price per new car sale in a given week is within $20 of the average price of all nationwide sales transactions during that week. However, please keep in mind that this is the average for all vehicles. If you are evaluating the average price for any specific vehicle (particularly one with very low sales volume), the deviation from the national average for that vehicle can be substantially greater.</p><br>


 <h1>How recent is your data?</h1>
<p>Our pricing information is updated weekly, and incentives are checked daily and updated as new information is validated. The transactions we use are the most recent available. Baic typically pushes data out to the site within 72 hours of receipt of the data. To ensure relevance, we typically only use transactions from the last four weeks, but we'll go back as far as 8 weeks if the market pricing for a given vehicle is stable enough to be relevant to a car purchased today.</p><br>


<h1> Why do certain vehicles not have a Price Report?</h1>
<p>We are committed to keeping our data up-to-date and accurate. When a vehicle has a very small history of recent purchases, it's difficult to provide reliable price ranges. We believe that not showing a Price Report is a better approach than suggesting or making an interpretation of the price.</p><br>


<h1> Why is Baic's Factory Invoice often higher than the Invoice Price I see on other sites?</h1>
<p>Often, manufacturers charge the dealer not only a Destination Charge, but also some additional fees such as extra freight fees, admin fees, fuel charges, and the most typical of all, Regional Ad Fees. Regional Ad Fees is the cost a manufacturer allocates for advertising and promoting the vehicle in the dealer's market. For example, all Toyota dealers pay Regional Ad Fees. These extra fees, like Destination Charges, are a legitimate cost to the dealer and should be added to the Factory Invoice. As a matter of fact, many dealers won't call it out but simply make them part of the Factory Invoice (which could make you believe the dealer is artificially inflating the price, especially when comparing the Factory Invoice found on other web sites). Baic includes these Regional Ad Fees and other extra fees, and the curious minds can always see the precise breakdown in our Table tab. This is, however, not a catch all. Taxes, title, license, registration, dealer documentation, after-market accessories, dealer installed options, etc. are costs added by the dealer (instead of the manufacturer) and are as such not part of the Factory Invoice. For more information, please check out our blog article, What is Included in Factory Invoice?</p><br>


 <h1>What fees are included in your pricing information?</h1>
<p>The Baic Price Estimate shown on the Certificate includes the destination fee and the regional advertising fee. The Baic Price Estimate does not include dealer installed accessories, applicable tax, title, licensing, and documentation fees, other state and governmental charges and/or fees, dealer-locate fees for out-of-stock vehicles, and any other charges and/or fees allowed by law.</p><br>


 <h1>Do you take consumer and dealer incentives into account?</h1>
<p>Absolutely. After you enter your ZIP code, our system identifies incentives applicable in your area.</p><br>


<h1> Can I license Baic's pricing information for my site?</h1>
<p>Baic has a number of options to provide pricing information on your website. Please contact us at contact@baic.com to find the solution that works best for you.</p>


<h1>Give Us Feedback
 I have a great story that I'd like to share about how much Baic helped me, who can I send it to?</h1>
We would be honored and encouraged to hear how we helped! Please send your stories to feedback@baic.com.</p><br>


<h1> Where do I report missing vehicles or options?</h1>
<p>If you catch any information missing from vehicle options, please let us know at feedback@baic.com.</p><br>


 <h1>How do I tell you about mistakes I've found on your site?</h1>
<p>Whether you are a car buyer and have found a problem with our Price Report, or are a dealer and have the most up to date information on incentives, we are critical about our data, and strive to be as accurate as possible. We want to know!! If you find any mistakes, please send a note to feedback@baic.com.</p><br>

<h1>Trademark Related Questions
<p> Is Baic endorsed by or sponsored by automobile manufacturers?</h1>

 <h1>What is Baic's relationship with automobile manufacturers?</h1>
<p>Baic provides a variety of information about vehicle makes, models, and specifications, but Baic’s presentation of information, including its Price Reports, is not endorsed or sponsored by automobile manufacturers. However, Baic does sell advertising space on its website, some of which is purchased by automobile manufactures for the display of their advertisements.</p><br>


<h1> Why are vehicles photos on the Baic website not identical to the photos I see on manufacturer websites?</h1>
<p>Baic generally licenses vehicles photos from independent photographers and/or companies who photograph the particular models you see on the website. In most cases, Baic does not obtain vehicle photos from the automobile manufacturers, so the angle, orientation, lighting, and other variables may differ from photos of the same model you see on an automobile manufacturer’s website. Vehicle photos are for reference purposes only, and do not imply any endorsement by, affiliation with, or sponsorship by the automobile manufacturer of the photographed vehicle.</p><br>


 <h1>Does Baic sell or service vehicles?</h1>
<p>Baic does not sell any type of vehicle or vehicle component, and does not service vehicles. Baic is a provider of information about vehicles.</p><br>
